THIS IS OUR PROGRAM THAT CREATES A DEQUE OF A GIVEN SIZE
AND RUNS IT THROUGH ROBOT SORT
ROBOTSORT -- 	YOU CAN SWAP THE TOP TWO SHEETS ON THE DEQUE
              OR YOU CAN SHIFT THE HEAD OF THE DEQUE TO TO BOTTOM
  				    1 > 2 -- SWAP
  				    1 < 2 -- SHIFT

  				    SPEACIAL CASE IS THE WRAP CASE HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE
